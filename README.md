# Reading Cyborg

## The Problem
With the rise of electronics in the past decade, books have replaced by technologies such as video games, phones, and ebooks as a source of entertainement and literature. However, children stories and fairytales are an important part in building up their literary, creativity, cognitive and language skils.

## Our Solution
Thus, with the rise of audio controlled home devices, we saw Amazon Alexa as a part of our solution. We designed an Amazon Alexa Skill that reads aloud children stories on prompt and completely hand-free. This not only solves the problem of children and their lack of reading since they can easily operate voice commands and listen to stories while in bed, but this also allows blind people to be able to more easily access these types of audio books since only their voice is required.

## About
